#  RNA Velocity measurement using Velocyto

RNA velocity is the time derivative of the gene expression state,
 [(La Manno et al., 2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0414-6) allows for the inference of the dynamic patterns in scRNA-seq data sets, by looking at the abundance of unspliced and spliced mRNA RNA in each cell, and modelling using a system of ordinary differential equations.

From a quantification point of view, RNA velocity analysis requires the generation of two count matrices, representing the spliced/processed (exonic) and unspliced/unprocessed RNA (intronic).

RNA velocity is a high-dimensional vector that predicts the future state of a cell on a timescale of hours.


### Example dataset

We'll use the example dataset from Mapping Comparison section from the paper, sample 654_small

[_"Single-Cell RNA-seq Reveals Profound Alterations in Mechanosensitive Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons With Vitamin E Deficiency"_](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31733517/)


and the cellranger count results folder from the [Mapping](scMapping) section.

```
/share/workshop/adv_scrnaseq/msettles/scrnaseq_processing/654_small
```

```bash
cd /share/workshop/adv_scrnaseq/$USER/scrnaseq_processing
```

we also need the gtf file used in creating the reference, which should be here:

```
/share/workshop/adv_scrnaseq/msettles/scrnaseq_processing/Reference/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.100.filtered.gtf .
```

### Next lets install the software [velocyto](https://velocyto.org/)

To install velocyto (a python application) we are going to use conda and a virtual environment

```bash
cd /share/workshop/adv_scrnaseq/$USER
module load anaconda3
conda create -p velocyto
conda activate /share/workshop/adv_scrnaseq/$USER/velocyto
```

If the environment 'activated' properly, than your prompt should look something like this.

```
(/share/workshop/adv_scrnaseq/msettles/velocyto) msettles@tadpole:/share/workshop/adv_scrnaseq/msettles$
```

If not you can try to initialize your bash
```bash
aklog
conda init bash
source /home/$USER/.bashrc
conda activate /share/workshop/adv_scrnaseq/$USER/velocyto
```

Once your conda environment is properly activated you can then install the softare.
```bash
# install prerequisites
conda install numpy scipy cython numba matplotlib scikit-learn h5py click
# install velocyto
pip install velocyto
```

and then test the installation
```bash
velocyto --help
```

It is also recommended to use a repetative sequence mask file, this is easiest to obtain from the [UCSC genome browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?hgsid=611454127_NtvlaW6xBSIRYJEBI0iRDEWisITa&clade=mammal&org=Mouse&db=mm10&hgta_group=allTracks&hgta_track=rmsk&hgta_table=0&hgta_regionType=genome&position=chr12%3A56694976-56714605&hgta_outputType=primaryTable&hgta_outputType=gff&hgta_outFileName=mm10_rmsk.gtf
).

You want to download the mask in gtf format. Unfortunately, Ensembl doesn't provide a gtf file for the repeat sequences and we'd have to generate one ourselves (write a script to do so) which is beyond the scope of this workshop.

###  Running Velocyto on Cellranger output

Lets first take a look at the help doc for run10x

```
velocyto run10x --help
```

Ok, now we are ready to run this on our sample

```bash
cd /share/workshop/adv_scrnaseq/$USER/scrnaseq_processing
velocyto run10x  654_small References/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.100.filtered.gtf
```

**This does fail to complete, the dataset is too small**
If you'd like to run to completion you can copy over the cellranger full dataset

```bash
cp -r /share/biocore/workshops/2020_scRNAseq/dataset_654/654 /share/workshop/adv_scrnaseq/$USER/scrnaseq_processing/654
```

### Output

Velocyto run10x simply produces a folder called velocyto in the sample directory with a single [loom](https://linnarssonlab.org/loompy/format/index.html) file in it, which contains the needed matrices for the analysis.

The output folder 654_small, now has a new folder called velocyto

```

and inside that folder is the loom file.

```
drwxrwsr-x 2 msettles biocore   3 May 28 08:50 .

-rw-rw-r-- 1 msettles biocore 56M May 28 08:52 654.loom
```

I expect that the 654_small dataset fails because their aren't enough reads, but on a full dataset it produces the loom file.
